This is a simple Twitch chat client.

It includes:
- Uninterrupted auto-scroll
- Badge and emoji display and caching
- Color-matching for the user

The `LineEdit` currently is not setup. If active, its intention would be to allow the streamer to send a message through it. 
This is very possible! All you need to do is set up an action in Streamer.bot with a parameter for your message, and a sub-action to send the message.

Why don't you give that a try?

Also there is one bug that I've found--the broadcaster badge refuses to show. Genuinely, not sure why. Will figure that out eventually.
