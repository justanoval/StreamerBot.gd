This is a multi-chat interface that works with YouTube and Twitch.

It includes:
- Uninterrupted auto-scroll
- Badge and emoji display and caching
- Color-matching for the user
- A chat box that only holds up to 100 chat messages at a time

For sending messages to work properly, you need to create "SendTwitchMessage" and "SendYouTubeMessage" actions that take the parameter `message`.

# Some things to note
- The YouTube chat will not work unless you are live.
- This example uses items from the `common` folder. Check that out to see the functionality, or make an issue if you have any questions.
