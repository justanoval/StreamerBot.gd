This is a multi-chat interface that works with YouTube and Twitch.

It includes:
- Uninterrupted auto-scroll
- Badge and emoji display and caching
- Color-matching for the user

For sending messages to work properly, you need to create "SendTwitchMessage" and "SendYouTubeMessage" actions that take the parameter `message`.

The YouTube chat will not work unless you are live.
